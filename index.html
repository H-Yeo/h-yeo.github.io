					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm a seasoned backend developer primarily focused on using C# and ASP .NET to create efficient microservice integrations. In addition, I have a strong background in working with legacy applications based on VB .NET and Classic ASP.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After having an opportunity with an amazing Vancouver retailer, I gained great insight in handling large-scale data, database design, stored procedures, and SSRS and SSIS packages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Right now, I'm enjoying the west coast life in beautiful Vancouver, BC. However, I do reminisce about the sun and mountains of the Rockies in Alberta. When I'm not coding or playing with tech gadgets, I enjoy hiking, playing soccer, snowboarding and dodgeball.
